TODO For this lab

1. Get the N-Tier nginx.conf working ... base it on the apphammer setup in your basement
2. Expose the web site logs into a folder so they can be viewed.
3. Get the three tier example working using mkdocs.
4. Simple static site


Demonstrate how to edit content in each example, discussing how the multiple tiers contribute to the applications complexity and therefore end-user simplicity.

Show how the services perform logging. using docker to see the logs, etc.
