# Lab 01 - Networking Basics

This lab uses two docker containers.

Start the lab
`$ docker-compose up -d`

Connect to the workstation
`$ docker-compose exec workstation bash`

And press ENTER an extra time to display the command prompt.

NOTE: IF you need to re-attach, complete the first command again. 

When you are done, make mamma proud and clean up after yourself!
`$ docker-compose down`
